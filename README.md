# tech-blog-mvc

## The main focus of this project is to create a tech blog following the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure.

The first step taken was to create the database using sql. After creating the database, I created 4 different tables that were linked with primary and foreign keys. I did include seeds for each table and the seeds can be seen when the deployed page is open in Heroku. Then I installed the npm package and once the packages were installed I worked on framework for a server, as we learned in class earlier in the week. Reviewing the past activities was really helpful with this homework assignment. I worked on the get, post, and delete functions for the server. I am still working on this code.
